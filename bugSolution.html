```html
<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4 flex-grow">
    <!--Some content-->
  </div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4 flex-grow">
    <!--Some content-->
  </div>
</div>
```
By adding `flex-grow`, we ensure that the divs expand to fill the available space, distributing the space according to their flex-grow value (which defaults to 1). This solves the issue of the divs not occupying the entire width.
